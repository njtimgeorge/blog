There's a man who lives down the street. He has a beat-up old car and lives in a small house. He wears older clothes. Perhaps he shops at Goodwill? He doesn't go out often, and it's mostly for grocery shopping. On nice days, he sits in his front yard and watches the world go by. His name is Matt Millionaire, or Matt M. for short. 

When he was young, Matt's father drilled it into his head that he should save $1,000,000, (a million dollars!) and then live off the interest. In that case he would never run out of money. By the age of 50, he had $1,000,000 and had paid off his house. He quit his job and never looked back.

Matt did a little research and found something called the 4% rule. Instead of putting his money in a savings account for interest (current rates are .5% according to <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/banking/savings-rates">nerdwallet<a>), he invested it wisely and decided to withdraw 4% a year.

If he put the money in the bank and lived off the interest, it would generate $5,000 a year or $416.66 a month. Instead, he earns the princely sum of $40,000 a year or $3333.33 a month. Big difference!

Unfortunately for Matt M. he has some bills. Real estate taxes at $5000/year, homeowners insurance at $1000/year, car insurance at $1000/year and health care. At age 60, his health insurance is $600/month. Ouch!

This leaves Matt M. $2150/month for food, entertainment, and to keep his old car running. I hope that his roof is solid: home repairs are expensive. I hope that he's healthy: co-payments and prescriptions can be expensive even with insurance. Hmmm, and what about taxes?

There you have it. A millionaire but no mansion. If he had a mansion, the property taxes would use up all his money. A millionaire with an old car. New car payments would eat into his grocery bills. A millionaire, but don't get sick...
