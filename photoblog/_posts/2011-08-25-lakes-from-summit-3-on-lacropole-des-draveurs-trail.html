<p>I almost didn't come up here. Summit 1 had a cliff that was giving me vertigo and it looked like the paths to the other summits might be on similar cliffs. Fortunately the trails weren't right on cliffs over the gorge. I had no idea these lakes were here until I got to summit 3 and the very welcome "Fin" sign.</p>
