<p>Unfairly, the bar reminds me of the lyrics:</p>
<p>"The hippies rode a wave putting smiles on faces,<br />
that the devil wouldnâ€™t even put a shoe<br />
Caught between a generation dying from its habits,<br />
and another thinking rock and roll was new<br />
Till the pawn shops were packed like a backstage party,<br />
hanging full of pointy ugly cheap guitars<br />
And the young'uns all turned to karaoke,<br />
hanging all their wishes upon disregarded stars"</p>
