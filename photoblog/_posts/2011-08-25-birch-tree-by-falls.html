<p>A birch tree/waterfall by the trailhead of L'Acropole-des-Draveurs in Hautes-Gorges-de-la-Rivière-Malbaie Park. A challenging trail because of the height you climb, it is still a very clear trail. At the beginning there are many waterfalls and the sound stays with you as you start up the trail.</p>
