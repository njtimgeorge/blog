<p>We felt Hurricane Irene all the way up here. After the rain, we still had the wind. I took to carrying my walking stick/flute on my shoulders and letting Irene whistle through. It produced some interesting sounds. It also reminded me that since I go hiking with a flute, perhaps I should learn to play the flute.</p>
