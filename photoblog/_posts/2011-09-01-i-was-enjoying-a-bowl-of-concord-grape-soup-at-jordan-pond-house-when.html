<p>Jordan Pond House across a meadow in Acadia National Park.</p>
<p>In 1985, I was having a snack at the Jordan Pond House with my grandfather and we noticed "Concord Grape Soup" on the menu. In my recollection, neither of us ordered it. He observed, though, that it would be interesting to open a conversation with the polite fiction "I was enjoying a bowl of Concord Grape Soup at Jordan Pond House when...". Throughout the ensuing decades, I have not had the opportunity to use this conversation opener. Perhaps in the future.</p>
