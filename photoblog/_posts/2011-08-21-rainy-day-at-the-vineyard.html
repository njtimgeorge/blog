<p>Rain on the first day of vacation is an unexpected blessing. Ile d'Orleans has one main road and it is right across the bridge from Quebec City. An island of art galleries, farms, and vineyards, it is usually very crowded on a summer weekend. Today, the wine tasting were leisurely. It is also easier to appreciate an art gallery without the crowds.</p>
